Simple Windows Forms calculator with basic functionality (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), as well as the option to calculate values of trigonoemtric functions, plotting them in a separate window, and a quadratic equation solver (which returns only real roots of the function). Comma is the decimal separator.

The text editor in the main form (Calculator window) only takes numerical values as the input (comma and minus have to be added by clicking a button). To calculate trigonometric funtion values, a value has to be present in the text editor - the functions use degrees (not radians) for calculations. The user can then calculate the value of a given trigonometric function or clear the screen. If the trigonometric function value is calculated, a separate window with a plot of the function and the value will pop up in another window.

To access the quadratic equation solver, the user has to click the "Quadratic equation button".

The text boxes take numerical values, minus and comma as input. If the given function has no real roots, the function will still be plotted, and a message that no real roots exist will be displayed.
