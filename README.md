# C# Windows Forms plotting calculator

## Main Window
Simple Windows Forms calculator with basic functionality (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), as well as the option to calculate values of trigonometric functions, plotting them in a separate window, and a quadratic equation solver (which returns only real roots of the function). Comma is the decimal separator.

## Trigonometric functions
The text editor in the main form (Calculator window) only takes numerical values as the input (comma and minus have to be added by clicking a button). To calculate trigonometric funtion values, a value has to be present in the text editor - the functions use degrees (not radians) for calculations. The user can then calculate the value of a given trigonometric function or clear the screen. If the trigonometric function value is calculated, a separate window with a plot of the function and the value will pop up in another window.

## Quadratic equation solver
To access the quadratic equation solver, the user has to click the "Quadratic equation" button.

The text boxes take numerical values, minus and comma as keyboard input. If the given function has no real roots, the function will still be plotted, and a message that no real roots exist will be displayed.

If the functions has real roots, they will be marked on the plot and their values will be displayed in the Quadratic equation solver window text box.
